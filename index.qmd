I advance NLP efforts at [VirtuousAI](https://virtuousai.com). At VirtuousAI, we research and develop explainable AI models.

Previously, I was a Sr. Computer Vision Engineer at [Intrinsic](https://intrinsic.ai) and at [Akasha Imaging](https://akasha.im) before Intrinsic acquired it. Before that, I graduated with an MS in [Computer Science at UCLA](https://cs.ucla.edu) supervised by [Achuta Kadambi](https://visual.ee.ucla.edu). My academic background is in computational imaging and I have an interest in *reasoning* AI (causality, knowledge representation, anything that is [system 2 learning](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/23/yoshua-bengio-neurips-2019-deep-learning/)).

Check out my [open-source Keras-wrapper](https://github.com/dorukkarinca/keras-buoy) for auto-saving training progress and metrics.

Background
------
I moved to California to obtain a BS in Computer Science and Engineering at UCLA (TED Ankara College prior to that). I stayed in the same department for my master's and worked on [generative synthetic dataset augmentation](https://dorukkarinca.com/publications/2021-06-10-overcoming-difficulty-in-obtaining) to improve remote heart rate detection.

The local part of my email address is dorukkarinca and the domain is https://cs.ucla.edu.
