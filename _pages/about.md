I am a second year master's student in [Computer Science at UCLA](https://cs.ucla.edu). My research interests are computer vision and causality.

Background
------
I lived in Turkey until the age of 18, graduated TED Ankara College Foundation High School and moved to California for my undergraduate studies. I graduated with a BS in Computer Science and Engineering from UCLA. I stayed in the same department for my master's and am currently working on [how to help detect your heartbeat from webcam videos of your face](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.12769) to help reduce hospital visits during COVID-19.
