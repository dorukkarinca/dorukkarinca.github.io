I finished my MS in [Computer Science at UCLA](https://cs.ucla.edu). My research interests are computer vision and causality.

Background
------
I moved to California to obtain a BS in Computer Science and Engineering at UCLA (TED Ankara College prior to that). I stayed in the same department for my master's and am currently working on [GAN-based synthetic dataset augmentation](https://dorukkarinca.com/publication/2021-06-10-overcoming-difficulty-in-obtaining) to improve remote heart rate detection.

The local part of my email address is dorukkarinca and the domain is https://cs.ucla.edu.
