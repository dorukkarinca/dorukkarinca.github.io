I graduated with an MS in [Computer Science at UCLA](https://cs.ucla.edu). My background is in computer vision and I have an interest in *reasoning* AI (causality, knowledge representation, anything that is [system 2 learning](https://bdtechtalks.com/2019/12/23/yoshua-bengio-neurips-2019-deep-learning/)).

Background
------
I moved to California to obtain a BS in Computer Science and Engineering at UCLA (TED Ankara College prior to that). I stayed in the same department for my master's and am currently working on [GAN-based synthetic dataset augmentation](https://dorukkarinca.com/publication/2021-06-10-overcoming-difficulty-in-obtaining) to improve remote heart rate detection.
