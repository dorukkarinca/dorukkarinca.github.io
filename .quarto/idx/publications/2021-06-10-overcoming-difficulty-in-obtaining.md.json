Recent deep learning architectures have improved the accuracy of such physiological measurement significantly, yet they are restricted by the diversity of the annotated videos. The existing datasets MMSE-HR, AFRL, and UBFC-RPPG contain roughly 10%, 0%, and 5% of dark-skinned subjects respectively. The unbalanced training sets result in a poor generalization capability to unseen subjects and lead to unwanted bias toward different demographic groups. In Western academia, it is regrettably difficult in a university setting to collect data on these dark-skinned subjects. Here we show a first attempt to overcome the lack of dark-skinned subjects by synthetic augmentation. A joint optimization framework is utilized to translate real videos from light-skinned subjects to dark skin tones while retaining their pulsatile signals. In the experiment, our method exhibits around 31% reduction in mean absolute error for the dark-skinned group and 46% improvement on bias mitigation for all the groups, as compared with the previous work trained with just real samples.\n\n[Download paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06007)\n\n\nY.
